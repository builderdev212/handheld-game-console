# handheld-game-console
A handheld game console that has custom games. The base of the console is an ESP-WROOM-32 DEVKITV1. The display used is an ili9431. The purpose of this project is to create a game engine based off of TFT_eSPI to allow people to create custom games and play them on microcontrollers. The collision detection code is based off of the methods that the TFT_eSPI uses to draw objects to the screen.
